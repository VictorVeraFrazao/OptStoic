# OptStoic
This package provides the tool for the LP/MILP procedure OptStoic and MinFlux in Julia.
## Description
OptStoic is a two-step MP/MILP procedure for *de novo* metabolic pathway construction, the first step being an maximization of the stoichiometric coefficients of target molecules in the given overall biochemical reaction (OptStoic) and the second being a minimization of flux of the reactions in order to create a shortest corresponding pathway (MinFlux). Both steps are, inter alia, constrained by energy and mass balance.
## Dependencies
This package heavily depends on the [COBREXA package](https://github.com/LCSB-BioCore/COBREXA.jl) to handle models in Julia as well as [eQuilibrator package](https://github.com/stelmo/Equilibrator.jl) for Component Contribution methods required by the energy constraints. Currently, the package only is compatible with well-curated SBML models, provided by [BiGG database](bigg.ucsd.edu/) and the Gurobi optimizer. It is planned to extend the usage onto large-scale databases and include support for other LP solvers.
## Current development status
The package is not stable and requires heavy fixes on built and overall code structure. The functions are not connected properly, so invoking the functions independently is required. The `OptStoic` optimization procedure in the `Analysis.jl` file is stable and works as far as tested after constructing a corresponding model. The `MinFlux` procedure still doesn't work as desired and needs fixing.
